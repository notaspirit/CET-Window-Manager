# Cyber Engine Tweaks Window Manager

The intention behind this is to create a window manager for Cyber Engine Tweaks in Cyberpunk 2077.
Once you have a couple of mods installed you will find that you entire cet window is plastered with just the headers of the windows and you can't find shit. 

So this mod will manage them for you, by allowing you to hide them, so they're gone when you don't need them.
